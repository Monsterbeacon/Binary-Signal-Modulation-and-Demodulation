## Project 3: Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) Modulation and Reconstruction  

**Objective**:  
Implement FSK modulation to encode digital signals and reconstruct the original signal using demodulation techniques.  

**Overview**:  
- **FSK Modulation**: Binary `1` maps to 50 kHz, and `0` maps to 5 kHz carrier frequencies.  
- **Demodulation**: Used a high-pass filter, envelope detector, and comparator to retrieve the signal.  

**Implementation**:  
- Simulated in PROTEUS and built on a breadboard, finalized on a PCB.  
- Key components: LF398N, Op-Amps, resistors, capacitors, and diodes.  

**Results**:  
- Successfully observed and reconstructed signals on an oscilloscope.  

**Cost**:  
- Total implementation cost: **Tk. 620**.
